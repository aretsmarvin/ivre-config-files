# A word of warning. This file performs ALL TCP scans. So even those such as RDP, test-ssl and Nuclei that might 
# end up freezing on some hosts. 
# A simple solution would be to exclude these scans with an if statement and afterwards run them manually to check if they freeze.
# Another trick that might be useful is to change the starting point. The first 6 scans in /etc/ivre.conf are "problematic" (see readme)
# thus changing i=0 to i=6 will skip these scans so they can ran manually.
